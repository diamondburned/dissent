Dissent (previously gtkcord4) is a third-party Discord client designed for a
smooth, native experience on Linux desktops.

Built with the GTK4 and libadwaita for a modern look and feel, it delivers your
favorite Discord app in a lightweight and visually appealing package.

### Features

Dissent offers a streamlined Discord experience, prioritizing simplicity and
speed over feature completeness on par with the official client. Here's what
you can expect:

- Text chat with complete Markdown and custom emoji support
- Guild folders and channel categories
- Tabbed chat interface
- Quick switcher for channels and servers
- Image and file uploads, previews, and downloads
- User theming via custom CSS
- Partial thread/forum support
- Partial message reaction support
- Partial AI summary support (provided by Discord)

It does not aim to support voice chat and other advanced features, as these are
best handled by the official client or the web app.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Using an unofficial client at all is against Discord's Terms of Service and
> may cause your account to be banned! While Dissent tries its best to not use
> the REST API at all unless necessary to reduce the risk of abuse, it is still
> possible that Discord may ban your account for using it. **Please use at your
> own risk!**

### Dependencies

Dissent needs GTK4, gobject-introspection, and optionally libcanberra. If compiling, then the library
headers are also required.
